# standalone-scripts

To execute the AEM related files, you need to set up the jacrabbit standalone jars in your build path.

Standalone jars could be downloaded directly from the jackrabbit site https://jackrabbit.apache.org/jcr/downloads.html

search for jackrabbit-standalone-*.jar

In my examples i have used jackrabbit-standalone-2.18.2.jar, but you can always get the latest and test it with them. See if there are any depreciated API's in the new jar.
